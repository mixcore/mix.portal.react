# Mixcore Automation App

The Automation App allows you to create, manage, and monitor automated workflows and rules in your Mixcore CMS installation.

## Features

- **Workflow Builder**: Create complex automation workflows with a visual builder
- **Rule Engine**: Set up conditional rules that trigger actions based on events
- **Scheduling**: Run workflows on a schedule or in response to events
- **Triggers**: Support for various trigger types including:
  - Scheduled (cron-based or relative)
  - Event-based
  - Webhook
  - API
  - Manual execution
- **Action Library**: Pre-built actions for common tasks:
  - Send notifications (email, in-app, SMS)
  - Create/update/delete content
  - User management
  - External API calls
  - File operations
  - Database operations
- **Condition Builder**: Create complex conditions with a visual builder
- **Logging**: Detailed execution logs for debugging and monitoring
- **Analytics**: Track workflow performance and success rates

## Getting Started

### Creating a Workflow

1. Navigate to the Automation app in your Mixcore dashboard
2. Click "New Workflow" to create a new workflow
3. Enter basic information (name, description, tags)
4. Configure the trigger that will start your workflow
5. Add steps to your workflow using the visual builder
6. Test your workflow using the built-in testing tools
7. Activate your workflow when ready

### Creating a Rule

1. Navigate to the Rules section in the Automation app
2. Click "New Rule" to create a new rule
3. Enter basic information (name, description, priority)
4. Configure the conditions that will trigger the rule
5. Define the actions to take when conditions are met
6. Test your rule using the built-in testing tools
7. Activate your rule when ready

## Use Cases

- **Content Management**: Automatically publish, update, or archive content based on schedules or conditions
- **User Onboarding**: Create onboarding sequences for new users
- **E-commerce**: Automate order processing, inventory management, and customer notifications
- **Notifications**: Send notifications to users or administrators based on various events
- **Data Synchronization**: Keep data in sync across different systems
- **Maintenance**: Automate regular maintenance tasks such as backups, cleanup, and health checks

## Best Practices

- Start with simple workflows and gradually add complexity
- Use tags to organize your workflows and rules
- Test thoroughly in a development environment before activating in production
- Monitor execution logs for errors and performance issues
- Use descriptive names and detailed descriptions for better organization
- Consider the performance impact of high-frequency triggers
- Use conditions to filter events and reduce unnecessary processing

## Technical Details

The Automation App integrates with various Mixcore subsystems:

- **MixDB**: Stores workflow definitions, rules, and execution logs
- **Event System**: Listens for events to trigger workflows and rules
- **Scheduler**: Executes scheduled workflows
- **Notification System**: Sends notifications to users and administrators
- **API Gateway**: Exposes webhooks and API endpoints for external triggers

## Troubleshooting

If your workflows or rules aren't working as expected:

1. Check the execution logs for errors or warnings
2. Verify that your triggers are properly configured
3. Test your conditions with sample data to ensure they evaluate as expected
4. Use the built-in debugger to step through complex workflows
5. Ensure that your actions have proper permissions to execute

## Limitations

- Workflow execution time is limited to prevent resource exhaustion
- Complex conditions may impact performance
- External API calls may be subject to rate limiting
- Scheduled workflows are executed with a variance of up to 1 minute
- Large data payloads may be truncated in logs

## Roadmap

- Visual flow designer with drag-and-drop interface
- Integration with third-party services (Zapier, IFTTT, etc.)
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- AI-powered workflow suggestions
- Custom action development SDK
- Performance optimizations for high-volume workflows
